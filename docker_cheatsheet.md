### Docker Cheatsheet

An **image** is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

A **container** is a runtime instance of an image – what the image becomes in memory when actually executed.

A **Dockerfile** will define what goes on in the environment inside your container.

In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services.” For example, if you imagine a video sharing site, there will probably be a service for storing application data in a database, a service for video transcoding in the background after a user uploads something, a service for the front-end, and so on.

A **service** really just means, “containers in production.” A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs – what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on. Scaling a service changes the number of container instances running that piece of software, assigning more computing resources to the service in the process.

Luckily it’s very easy to define, run, and scale services with the Docker platform – just write a **docker-compose.yml** file.

A **swarm** is a group of machines that are running Docker and have been joined into a cluster. After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands you’re used to, but now they are executed on a cluster by a **swarm manager**. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they are referred to as **nodes**. Swarm managers are the only machines in a swarm that can execute your commands, or authorize other machines to join the swarm as **workers**.

A **stack** is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A single stack is capable of defining and coordinating the functionality of an entire application (though very complex applications may want to use multiple stacks).

From the top of the hierarchy down:
  - stack (can contain multiple services)
  - services, managed as swarms
  - images, which are built into containers at runtime

```bash
docker build -t friendlyname .  # Create image using this directory's Dockerfile
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyname  # Run "friendlyname" mapping port 4000 to 80
docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyname         # Same thing, but in detached mode
docker ps                                 # See a list of all running containers
docker stop <hash>                     # Gracefully stop the specified container
docker ps -a           # See a list of all containers, even the ones not running
docker kill <hash>                   # Force shutdown of the specified container
docker rm <hash>              # Remove the specified container from this machine
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)           # Remove all containers from this machine
docker images -a                               # Show all images on this machine
docker rmi <imagename>            # Remove the specified image from this machine
docker rmi $(docker images -q)             # Remove all images from this machine
docker login             # Log in this CLI session using your Docker credentials
docker tag <image> username/repository:tag  # Tag <image> for upload to registry
docker push username/repository:tag            # Upload tagged image to registry
docker run username/repository:tag                   # Run image from a registry

docker-compose up # Create and start containers
docker-compose build # Build or rebuild services

docker stack ls              # List all running applications on this Docker host
docker stack deploy -c <composefile> <appname>  # Run the specified Compose file
docker stack services <appname>       # List the services associated with an app
docker stack ps <appname>   # List the running containers associated with an app
docker stack rm <appname>                             # Tear down an application

docker-machine ssh myvm1   # Open an SSH session with the VM; type "exit" to end
docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"  # Make the worker leave the swarm
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave -f" # Make master leave, kill swarm
docker-machine start myvm1            # Start a VM that is currently not running
docker-machine stop $(docker-machine ls -q)               # Stop all running VMs
docker-machine rm $(docker-machine ls -q) # Delete all VMs and their disk images
docker-machine scp docker-compose.yml myvm1:~     # Copy file to node's home dir
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>"   # Deploy an app
